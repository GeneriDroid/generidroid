# GenerDroid - An Treble Droid based AOSP GSI
GeneriDroid is a GSI project that aims at mainly making daily builds of Treble Droid with some additonal Open Source apps and tweaks. Issues should primarily be sent [Here](https://github.com/ponces/treble_aosp/issues/new/choose) as this is just slight tweaks to Treble Droid.

## Build
To get started with building AOSP GSI, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).
- Create a new working directory for your AOSP build and navigate to it:
    ```
    mkdir aosp; cd aosp
    ```
- Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/GeneriDroid/generidroid -b android-14.0
    ```
- Finally, start the build script:
    ```
    bash generidroid/build.sh
    ```
